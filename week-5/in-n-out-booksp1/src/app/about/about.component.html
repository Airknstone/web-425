    <h1 class="blue">Who was Philip K. Dick</h1>
    <p>
      Philip Kindred Dick (December 16, 1928 â€“ March 2, 1982) was an American novelist, short story writer and essayist
      whose published work is almost entirely in the science fiction genre. Dick explored sociological, political and
      metaphysical themes in novels dominated by monopolistic corporations, authoritarian governments and altered
      states. In his later works, Dick focused strongly on metaphysics and theology. He often drew upon his own life
      experiences in addressing the nature of drug abuse, paranoia and schizophrenia, and transcendental experiences
